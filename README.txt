			Assignment 5 Instructions - Running the program

There are a total of four arguments to run assignment5.py
 - The first argument is the file name
 - The second argument is the image name
 - The third argument is the K-Value
 - The fourth argument is the number of iterations

(Suggestion to grader: With more iterations the program takes a while to compile as I tried with iterations of 40 or above and it took more than a few minutes to run). I suggest for testing keep the iterations to 5 or below as they eventually converged according to the K-means algorithm.
